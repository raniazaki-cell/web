 <h2> Early Writings, 1872–76
<p> Nietzsche published his first book, The Birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music, in 1872. The book questions the dominant eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century portrait of Greek culture, rooted in Johann Winckelmann’s History of Ancient Art (1764). Winckelmann portrayed ancient Greece as rational, noble, and serene. Nietzsche, by contrast, defines ancient Greek culture by the opposition between the Apollonian dream and Dionysian intoxication, which he develops into the pairs “individual and community,” “family and city,” “law-convention and nature,” “image and music,” and “appearance and illusion.” He discerns the tension between the beauty of the Olympian gods and the terror of tragedy but finds terror to be the more fundamental and original source, even of the Apollonian. The Apollonian and Dionysian pair become transformed into the oppositions between thought and affects, reason and passion, and from there the discussion moves from Euripides to Socrates, and the problem he represents.
The Birth of Tragedy contains the germ of much of Nietzsche’s later thought, in which the relation of knowledge of the true and the question of its goodness or benefit becomes the primary question, a question first raised by Socrates and raised again by Nietzsche.
From 1873 to 1876 Nietzsche wrote his Untimely Meditations. While intending to write thirteen studies, Nietzsche completed only four, devoted to the decline of contemporary European, especially, German culture: David Strauss, the Confessor and the Writer, (1873); On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life (1874); Schopenhauer as Educator (1874); Richard Wagner in Bayreuth (1876).
In On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life, Nietzsche deepens his treatment of the question, Why science?, or the question of the disproportion between the pursuit of truth and the goodness of that pursuit. Nietzsche discusses how the scientific pursuit of the historical schools issues in a new phenomenon, “historicism,” or the relativity of all horizons and values, and the potential harmful implications of that discovery. For how can humanity live without closed horizons once the scientific pursuit of history has pierced all such myths and illusory veils and revealed only arbitrary values? Nietzsche also makes clear that his generation is the first to find itself in the position of knowing that it does not know. This situation is the result of the probity celebrated by millennia of Christianity, now refined into science and the democratic movement and turned against God and its Christian origins, in which Christian morality persists despite the death of the Christian god. The final two essays, on Schopenhauer and Wagner, look to them as heroic potential redeemer types of German culture and the West.
