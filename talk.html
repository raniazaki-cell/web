			<h2>Early Works</h2>
			<p> Nietzsche published his first book,"The Birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music", in 1872. The book questions the dominant eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century portrait of Greek culture, rooted in Johann Winckelmann’s "History of Ancient Art" (1764). Winckelmann portrayed ancient Greece as rational, noble, and serene. Nietzsche, by contrast, defines ancient Greek culture by the opposition between the Apollonian dream and Dionysian intoxication, which he develops into the pairs “individual and community,” “family and city,” “law-convention and nature,” “image and music,” and “appearance and illusion.” He discerns the tension between the beauty of the Olympian gods and the terror of tragedy but finds terror to be the more fundamental and original source, even of the Apollonian. The Apollonian and Dionysian pair become transformed into the oppositions between thought and affects, reason and passion, and from there the discussion moves from Euripides to Socrates, and the problem he represents. <p>
      "The Birth of Tragedy" contains the germ of much of Nietzsche’s later thought, in which the relation of knowledge of the true and the question of its goodness or benefit becomes the primary question, a question first raised by Socrates and raised again by Nietzsche. From 1873 to 1876 Nietzsche wrote his Untimely Meditations. While intending to write thirteen studies, Nietzsche completed only four, devoted to the decline of contemporary European, especially, German culture: David Strauss, the "Confessor and the Writer", (1873); "On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life* (1874); "Schopenhauer as Educator" (1874); "Richard Wagner in Bayreuth" (1876).

		<h2>Middle Works</h2>
		<p> In 1878 Nietzsche completed "Human, All-Too-Human" The following year he added a second part, "Mixed Opinions and Maxims", which he followed with a third part—The Wanderer and His Shadow (Der Wanderer und sein Schatten) —in 1880. In 1886 the three parts were published together as "Human, All-Too-Human", "A Book for Free Spirits." Eschewing any philosophical “system,” and sensitive to the question of form and style in philosophical writing, Nietzsche composed these works as a series of several hundred aphorisms. Throughout, he reflects upon—and subjects to rigorous critique—myriad cultural, political, and psychological phenomena and theological and metaphysical opinions. The idea of power—for which he would later gain notoriety—appears here as an explanatory principle, but at this stage of his thinking Nietzsche emphasizes hedonistic considerations rooted in biological or instinctual forces. From the standpoint of his later dismissive criticisms of all hedonistic and utilitarian accounts, "Human, All-Too-Human" thus appears to some readers as an uncharacteristic work, inspired by positivist science. <p>

			<h2>Late  Works</h2>
			<p> Nietzsche composed his most famous work, "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", "A Book for All and None" from 1883–85. It is at once a manifesto of personal self-overcoming and a guide for others. 150,000 copies of the work were printed by the German government and issued with the Bible to young soldiers during WWI. And this, despite the fact that Thus Spoke Zarathustra’s complex rhetorical, poetic and prophetic style was meant to supplant all older teachings. The book is full of rich and suggestive metaphors of nature often redolent of “pre-Socratic” (a term we owe to Nietzsche) naturalist philosophy, which invoke animals, earth, air, fire, water, celestial bodies, and plants, all in the service of characterizing the spiritual growth of Zarathustra, a solitary, reflective, exceedingly strong-willed, sage-like, laughing and dancing voice of heroic self-mastery who, accompanied by a proud, sharp-eyed eagle and a wise snake, envisions a mode of psychologically-healthier being, beyond what has been known as the human condition hitherto. Nietzsche refers to this higher mode of being as “superhuman” (übermenschlich) and associates it with the doctrine of “eternal recurrence”—a doctrine only for the healthiest who can love life in its entirety.<p>
